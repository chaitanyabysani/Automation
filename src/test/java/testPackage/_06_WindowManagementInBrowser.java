 * 	There are several instances in test automation wherein one might need to open a particular link in a new tab or window to perform 	certain actions. To achieve this in Selenium 3, QAs had to create a new driver object and then perform the switch operation using 	the WindowHandle method to perform subsequent steps.

	This is set to change in Selenium 4 as it comes with a new API â€“ newWindow that allows users to create and switch to a new 	window/tab without creating a new WebDriver object.
